Create a task manager application using JavaScript, HTML, CSS. The task manager should allow user to add, view, edit, and delete tasks, each task should have a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., “pending”, “in progress”, “complete”)

Requirements:
1. Create an HTML file with appropriate elements for the task manager interface, such as
input field for task details, buttons to add, edit, and delete tasks, and a display area to
display the list of tasks.
2. Use CSS to style the task manager and make it visually appealing.
3. Implement JavaScript functionality to handle the following tasks:
a. Adding a new task: When the user clicks the “Add Task” button, a new task should
be created and added to the task list.
b. Viewing the task list: Display the list of tasks with respective details, including the
task title, description, due date and status.
c. Editing a task: Allow the user to edit task details by clicking on the “Edit” button
next to each task. Update the task details accordingly.
d. Deleting a Task: Allow the user to delete a task by clicking on the “Delete” button
next to each task. Remove the task from the task list.
e. Updating the task status: Provide options for the user to change the status of a
task (e.g., from “pending” to “In progress” or “completed”).
f. Task status “complete”: Once a task is complete, disable the “Edit” button for that
task.
4. Store the tasks in memory (e.g., an array of objects) for simplicity, you don’t need to
implement a persistent storage.
5. Use appropriate event handlers and DOM manipulation to achieve the desired
functionality.
